# 2024 Ohio State FEH Robotics Competition Project

This repo was created post-competition, to document the code I wrote for our robot. 

## Overview

- Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance  
- Sensor integration and feedback control  
- Modular and reusable code components for rapid iteration  
- Designed to work with the FEH Proteus libraries and hardware platform  

## Libraries
